      "body": "is a 1993 video album by American recording artist Mariah Carey. It presents her singing at Proctor's Theatre (pictured) in Schenectady, New York, and also includes non-concert footage. Carey performs ten songs; four are from her third studio album Music Box (1993), which her record label, Columbia, commissioned the hour-long video to promote. She is sporadically accompanied by a band, a choir, dancers, and string players. In creating the stage for the performance, production designers sought inspiration from works by Boris Aronson and Josep Maria Jujol. Television network NBC broadcast it on November 25, 1993, to an audience of 19 million. Columbia Music Video released it on VHS five days later to generally positive reviews from critics. It received a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America and was one of the best-selling video albums of 1994 and 1995 in the United States.",
